What is the difference between the map and the foreach function?
    -forEach can execute a function for each components of an array, while map can take the array and use it's components to create an entirely new array.
    -Foreach is good for mutating or changing the array which is why it doesn't return anything, while map is good for creating a whole new array based off the array it is being used it meaning maps will always have a return
